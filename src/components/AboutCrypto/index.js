        <h1>What are Cryptocurrencies?</h1>
        <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency designed to 
          work as a medium of exchange. It uses cryptography to secure and 
          verify transactions as well as to control the creation of new units 
          of a particular cryptocurrency. Essentially, cryptocurrencies are 
          limited entries in a database that no one can change unless specific 
          conditions are fulfilled.</p>
